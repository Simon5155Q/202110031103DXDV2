
Future plans:

# have to add random movement and drgns have to disappear when plr moves away even when not overlapping(not perfect)
# chunk loading (optimisation required)
# spawn limit for drgns (not perfect) - even though the value of the variable spawn limit is 25 only 3 dragon sprites spawn (the variable value is 25 as of 9/14/2021)
# spawn area where drgns can not spawn
# hp bar for both plr and drgn
# optimisation and loading screen (not perfectly fixed)
# take textures from project utmou or open game art
# visibilty for the chunks
# game state and character selection (use database)
# needs more sprite sheets for dragons and other hostile sprites
# while touching the water the player has to slow down or have some animation change (same goes for sand)
# custom text designs
# better forests (better clusters, closer together)
# inventory
# items and weapons for each class
# damage and health calculation system 

bugs:

# When two opposite keys are pressed for ex: W and A (front and back keys), the spawn, dragons move on the last pressed direction, but the player alone stops.
# movement of various sprites is wacky and imperfect
# scrolling option is still visible (need to fix the display width and height)
# optimization  

notes:

# the json values update, however for the updates to be seen, the sprite has to be in a function such as function draw that loops.
